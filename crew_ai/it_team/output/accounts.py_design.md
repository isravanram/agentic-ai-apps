# Module Name: `accounts.py`

The design outlines the structure for a Python module that provides account management for a trading simulation platform. The system needs to handle user accounts, manage balance changes, deal with share transactions, and report account status and performance. The design ensures everything is contained within a single module, which can be easily adapted for testing or UI integration.

## Class: `Account`
This class represents the user's account, handling their balance, portfolio, and transactions. It uses helper methods to perform various operations like deposits, withdrawals, and tracking of share transactions.

### Method: `__init__(self, initial_deposit: float) -> None`
- Initializes a new account with an initial deposit.
- Parameters:
  - `initial_deposit`: The initial amount of funds deposited into the account.
- Attributes:
  - `balance`: Current balance in the account.
  - `initial_deposit`: Record of initial deposit for profit/loss calculation.
  - `portfolio`: Dictionary to hold shares owned and their quantities.
  - `transactions`: List to store a history of transactions (buy/sell).

### Method: `deposit(self, amount: float) -> None`
- Adds the specified amount to the account balance.
- Parameters:
  - `amount`: The amount to deposit into the account.
- Ensures that the deposit amount is positive.

### Method: `withdraw(self, amount: float) -> bool`
- Attempts to withdraw the specified amount from the account balance.
- Parameters:
  - `amount`: The amount to withdraw from the account.
- Returns:
  - `True` if the withdrawal is successful, otherwise `False`.
- Ensures that the withdrawal does not leave a negative balance.

### Method: `buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int, share_price_func) -> bool`
- Records the purchase of shares.
- Parameters:
  - `symbol`: The stock symbol of the shares being purchased.
  - `quantity`: The number of shares to purchase.
  - `share_price_func`: A function that returns the current share price for a given stock symbol.
- Returns:
  - `True` if the purchase is successful, otherwise `False`.
- Ensures that the purchase does not exceed available funds.

### Method: `sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int, share_price_func) -> bool`
- Records the selling of shares.
- Parameters:
  - `symbol`: The stock symbol of the shares being sold.
  - `quantity`: The number of shares to sell.
  - `share_price_func`: A function that returns the current share price for a given stock symbol.
- Returns:
  - `True` if the sale is executed successfully, otherwise `False`.
- Ensures that shares to be sold are available in the user's portfolio.

### Method: `get_portfolio_value(self, share_price_func) -> float`
- Calculates the total current value of the user's portfolio.
- Parameters:
  - `share_price_func`: A function that returns the current share price for a given stock symbol.
- Returns:
  - Total value of shares owned, calculated using the latest prices.

### Method: `get_profit_or_loss(self, share_price_func) -> float`
- Calculates the profit or loss since the account was created.
- Parameters:
  - `share_price_func`: A function that returns the current share price for a given stock symbol.
- Returns:
  - Net profit or loss calculated from current portfolio value and remaining balance against initial deposit.

### Method: `get_holdings(self) -> dict`
- Provides a current report of stocks and quantities held in the user's account.
- Returns:
  - A dictionary representation of the portfolio holdings.

### Method: `get_transaction_history(self) -> list`
- Provides a history of all buy and sell transactions executed through the account.

The functions are intended to handle edge cases like insufficient funds, non-existent shares, or attempts to perform invalid transactions adhering to the outlined business rules.
